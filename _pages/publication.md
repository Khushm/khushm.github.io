**[Predicting the Transition From Depression to Suicidal Ideation Using Facebook Data Among Indian-Bangladeshi Individuals: Protocol for a Cohort Study](https://www.researchprotocols.org/2024/1/e55511)**  
Published in *JMIR*, 2023

In South Asia, suicide rates range from 9.8 to 13.0 per 100,000, with over 260 million individuals affected by mental health conditions and a severe shortage of mental health professionals. Our published protocol addresses this crisis by leveraging Facebook data to predict transitions from depression to suicidal ideation among Indian-Bangladeshi individuals. I developed NLP pipelines to analyze multilingual text, identifying linguistic markers of distress within cultural contexts. This novel approach offers early risk detection for underserved populations, aiming to empower clinicians with actionable insights. The research lays the groundwork for real-time interventions, addressing a critical public health challenge.
