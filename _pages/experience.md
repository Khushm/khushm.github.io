      <h3>Software Developer Intern</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.tomtom.com/" target="_blank">TomTom</a></p>
      <span>Jul 2022 - Dec 2022</span>
      <p class="details">Led the development of a high-precision Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using Regex and Stanza, enabling the extraction of location and date-time entities from vast multilingual datasets. This improved lead identification, increasing relevance by 25% and enhancing data processing efficiency for a leading geospatial mapping company. I also engineered a multi-label text classification model, significantly improving the categorization of leads by refining the algorithm's precision, resulting in faster, more accurate categorization processes. Additionally, as part of a Sofathon, I designed and implemented an advanced image translation system using pix2pix and GANs, accelerating image processing times and reducing overhead by 40%. My approach leveraged TensorFlow and PyTorch, optimizing the models for real-time deployment. These innovations not only streamlined data updates but also enhanced the overall user experience, making it more responsive and scalable. The 8/10 score for strategy and implementation in the Sofathon further validated the effectiveness of the solutions. Through this work, I gained expertise in NLP, deep learning, and AI model deployment, equipping me to deliver impactful, scalable solutions that drive efficiency and performance across dynamic environments.</p>

      <h3>Al&ML Intern</h3>
      <p><a href="https://smartiam.in/" target="_blank">Integrated Active Monitoring Pvt. Ltd., India</a></p>
      <span>Oct 2021 - Apr 2022</span>
      <p class="details">Spearheaded the automation of critical surveillance processes, cutting manual efforts by 80% and enabling real-time truck detection and tracking using PP-Yolo and Byte-Tracker models. Enhanced security operations by automating CCTV monitoring with OpenCV, implementing features to detect video blur, scene changes, time mismatches, video loss, and hard disk health issues, improving system reliability by 40%. Developed an OCR system with PaddleOCR, boosting skewed text recognition accuracy by 25%, and built predictive models for age, gender, and emotion detection, increasing image analysis accuracy by 30%. <br>
Designed and deployed an end-to-end data processing pipeline integrating a ReactJS UI, FastAPI backend, MongoDB for data retrieval, RabbitMQ for efficient messaging, and Docker for containerization, accelerating data processing speeds by 50%. These innovations significantly improved operational efficiency, ensuring faster alerts and greater reliability in real-time tracking and security monitoring. This project reinforced my expertise in computer vision and automation while delivering measurable business impact and showcasing my ability to create scalable, high-performing solutions.
