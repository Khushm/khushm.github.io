      <h3>Student Teaching Assistant</h3>
      <p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nsuhci" target="_blank">North South University</a></p>
      <span>Jan 2023 – Jul 2024</span>
      <p class="details">Engineered innovative data collection systems to support cutting-edge research in mental health. For the suicidal ideation project, I developed a robust pipeline to gather and preprocess data from over 10,000 Facebook posts, utilizing text, emoji usage, and user interaction data to identify patterns linked to depression and suicidal thoughts. This effort directly contributed to the creation of a predictive model aimed at suicide prevention in South Asia, addressing regional challenges in behavioral patterns, socioeconomic factors, and language nuances. In parallel, I spearheaded the data analysis for the infodemic news analysis project, where I collected and processed a 4-year dataset of news articles from India, Bangladesh, and the UK. Using NLP techniques, I identified trends in misinformation during public health crises, providing actionable insights to enhance global public health response strategies. Additionally, I collaborated on building a machine learning model for stress level assessments based on psychological metrics (PSS, BFI-2), improving the accuracy of mental health diagnostics. This work reinforced my technical skills in Python, NLP, and data analytics, while also deepening my understanding of how data-driven approaches can address critical social challenges.</p>

      <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.markytics.com/" target="_blank">Markytics</a></p>
      <span>Feb 2023 – Sep 2023</span>
      <p class="details">Orchestrated the development of a robust sales forecasting model, achieving 92% accuracy using a customized FB-Prophet approach. This breakthrough significantly enhanced client decision-making and operational planning, directly contributing to improved forecasting precision, reduced operational costs, and increased client satisfaction. Collaborating with 10 stakeholders, I translated diverse business requirements into a scalable SaaS-based Point of Sale (POS) system, leveraging Django and React to seamlessly integrate real-time sales and returns reporting via REST APIs, which streamlined internal operations and reduced reporting time by 30%. <br> To further enhance client communication, I developed and deployed a WhatsApp bot service, providing clients with real-time updates and improving engagement. By utilizing SQL, I optimized data extraction and preprocessing workflows, which not only improved model accuracy but also led to faster and more efficient data handling. Leading the team to deliver the POS system, I mentored 20 new employees in technical skills like Python, Django, and PostgreSQL. This not only fostered a culture of continuous learning but also strengthened the team’s overall technical proficiency. <br> This experience deepened my ability to bridge technical expertise with business outcomes, strengthening my problem-solving, leadership, and mentoring capabilities.</p>

      <h3>Software Developer Intern</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.tomtom.com/" target="_blank">TomTom</a></p>
      <span>Jul 2022 - Dec 2022</span>
      <p class="details">Led the development of a high-precision Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using Regex and Stanza, enabling the extraction of location and date-time entities from vast multilingual datasets. This improved lead identification, increasing relevance by 25% and enhancing data processing efficiency for a leading geospatial mapping company. I also engineered a multi-label text classification model, significantly improving the categorization of leads by refining the algorithm's precision, resulting in faster, more accurate categorization processes. Additionally, as part of a Sofathon, I designed and implemented an advanced image translation system using pix2pix and GANs, accelerating image processing times and reducing overhead by 40%. My approach leveraged TensorFlow and PyTorch, optimizing the models for real-time deployment. These innovations not only streamlined data updates but also enhanced the overall user experience, making it more responsive and scalable. The 8/10 score for strategy and implementation in the Sofathon further validated the effectiveness of the solutions. Through this work, I gained expertise in NLP, deep learning, and AI model deployment, equipping me to deliver impactful, scalable solutions that drive efficiency and performance across dynamic environments.</p>
