      <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
      <p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nsuhci" target="_blank">North South University</a></p>
      <span>Jan 2023 – Jul 2024</span>
      <p class="details">Engineered innovative data collection systems to support cutting-edge research in mental health. For the suicidal ideation project, I developed a robust pipeline to gather and preprocess data from over 10,000 Facebook posts, utilizing text, emoji usage, and user interaction data to identify patterns linked to depression and suicidal thoughts. This effort directly contributed to the creation of a predictive model aimed at suicide prevention in South Asia, addressing regional challenges in behavioral patterns, socioeconomic factors, and language nuances. In parallel, I spearheaded the data analysis for the infodemic news analysis project, where I collected and processed a 4-year dataset of news articles from India, Bangladesh, and the UK. Using NLP techniques, I identified trends in misinformation during public health crises, providing actionable insights to enhance global public health response strategies. Additionally, I collaborated on building a machine learning model for stress level assessments based on psychological metrics (PSS, BFI-2), improving the accuracy of mental health diagnostics. This work reinforced my technical skills in Python, NLP, and data analytics, while also deepening my understanding of how data-driven approaches can address critical social challenges.</p>
